<h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
<p>I didn't really do a lot in my revision. I focused on making it look better and more lively by brightening the colors and using professional-looking pictures. I tried doing other things, but it just kept breaking the entire code.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the semester, I felt good about handling my work and understanding what we learned in class. One of my favorite parts was working on the CSS demo, which was easy and fun. I was amazed at how CSS can change the look of a website and make it nicer to see. I didn't realize how much coding affects how everything works and looks online. Learning these skills showed me the creative and technical sides of web design, which I thought was inspiring.</p>
<p>I do sincerly apologize for not coming to class regularly and learning with my classmates. This semester, my other classes were very demanding, and I had a lot of hard assignments and strict deadlines. I had a tough time keeping up with everything, which made it hard for me to stay on track. Even though I missed some classes, your videos helped me learn the material in a way that worked for me, and I'm very thankful for that. I see now that I could have managed my time better.</p>
<p>I'm going to make some changes to my HTML files to make them stand out and to use what I've learned. I didn't make big changes during the course because I was a bit overwhelmed, but now I feel ready to try new things and improve my work. I've really liked being in this class and learning new skills, which has been a great experience for me. What I've learned will definitely help me as I keep studying, and I'm excited to see how I can build on this in the future.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>I think progressive enhancement is important, because it makes sure that content and features are available for users with outdated technology. Applications with progressive enhancement are built and won't break as easily due to browser inconsistencies or missing features. By accommodating with a lot of devices and user contexts, progressive enhancement helps developers provide to a larger audience, even people in regions with less advanced tech.</p>
<p>As technology gets better, progressive enhancement helps that websites remain constant, even with specific features or APIs that aren't available. </p>
