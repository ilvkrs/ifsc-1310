<h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the semester, I felt good about handling my work and understanding what we learned in class. One of my favorite parts was working on the CSS demo, which was easy and fun. I was amazed at how CSS can change the look of a website and make it nicer to see. I didn't realize how much coding affects how everything works and looks online. Learning these skills showed me the creative and technical sides of web design, which I thought was inspiring.</p>
<p>I do sincerly apologize for not coming to class regularly and learning with my classmates. This semester, my other classes were very demanding, and I had a lot of hard assignments and strict deadlines. I had a tough time keeping up with everything, which made it hard for me to stay on track. Even though I missed some classes, your videos helped me learn the material in a way that worked for me, and I'm very thankful for that. I see now that I could have managed my time better.</p>
<p>I'm going to make some changes to my HTML files to make them stand out and to use what I've learned. I didn't make big changes during the course because I was a bit overwhelmed, but now I feel ready to try new things and improve my work. I've really liked being in this class and learning new skills, which has been a great experience for me. What I've learned will definitely help me as I keep studying, and I'm excited to see how I can build on this in the future.</p>
